Asserted number of subspecimens	An asserted count of specimens derived from this specimen (cumulative)	APOLLO_SV:00000032	count	A measurement datum that is the output of counting.
Specimen type	Type of specimen (excised tissue block, slice, cell, etc.)	AIO:specimen type name	specimen type name	A textual entity that denotes the type of a specimen.
Hemisphere	Hemisphere that this specimen came from (left, right, both, neither, unknown)	PATO:0000140	position	A spatial quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the bearer's spatial location relative to other objects in the vicinity.
Anatomical structure	Specimens location within anatomical structures from brain atlas and atlas name	PATO:0000141	structure	A morphology quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the bearer's relative position, shape, arrangements and connectivity of an organism's various parts; the pattern underlying its form.
