# Using the website

## Navigation
Navigating through the webpage is performed by selecting options from the first
drop-down menu and selecting the `Next` button to the right of the menu. 
At any time you can select `Back` to return to the previous page.

### Select a program
There should be a drop-down menu at the bottom of the screen that says `Select a program`. 
Choose either `BICCN` or`Allen Brain Map` from the menu, then select `Next`.

### Select a subprogram
The drop-down menu at the bottom of the screen should now say `Select a subprogram`.
Choose the relevant option from the menu. For BICCN projects, this should be the
name of your grant. Select `Next`. At this point you should be on a page with 
information about your subprogram. This information on this page is currently 
not displayed on https://knowledge.brain-map.org. Do not edit any of the 
information on this page unless you the person are responsible for the 
management of this subprogram.

### Select a project
The drop-down menu should now say `Select a project`. The options on this menu
are the titles of projects that are published on https://knowledge.brain-map.org.
Choose the title of your project, then select `Next`. You can request any 
necessary changes to your project information and submit them from this page.
The process for requesting changes is described in a later section of these
instructions here: [Requesting changes](web_ui_instructions.md#Requesting changes)

### Select a data collection
The drop-down menu should now say `Select a data collection`. The options on this menu
are the titles of data collections that are published on https://knowledge.brain-map.org.
Choose the title of your data collection, then select `Next`. You can request any 
necessary changes to your data collection information and submit them from this page.
The process for requesting changes is described in a later section of these
instructions here: [Requesting changes](web_ui_instructions.md#Requesting changes)

## Requesting changes
The mechanism for making changes to a project or data collection is the same
for both cases. Note that if you navigate away from the page you are editing 
before hitting the `Submit` button, then your changes **will not be saved**. 
Therefore, please make sure to hit the `Submit` button at the bottom of the page 
before navigating to the next one.

### Adding additional properties
You can add additional properties to your project or data collection by choosing 
a property from the `Add additional properties` drop-down menu that is below
the navigation menu. Then, select the `value ...` button to the right of the
`Add additional properties` menu. You can then either choose an option from
another drop-down menu or type in a value, depending on the property that you
chose. Once you are down choosing a value, select the `Add this property` button
to add that value to the requested changes list (Note that this request is not
finalized until you select the `Submit` button at the bottom of the page).

### Modifying existing properties
You can modify any existing properties in the `Modify existing properties` 
section, which is below the `Add additional properties` section. To do this,
edit the text fields or select different options from the drop-down menus.
Remember that change requests will not be finalized until you select the `Submit`
button and that the requests will be lost if you navigate away from the current
project or data collection that you are modifying.

### Deleting existing properties
You can also delete existing properties in the `Modify existing properties`
section by checking boxes in the `Delete` column to the right of the properties
that you want to delete. Again, deletion requests will not be finalized until 
you select the `Submit` button, and the requests will be lost if you 
navigate away from the current project or data collection that you are modifying.

### Adding comments
You can add comments about your change requests in the `Additional comments`
section, which is below the `Modify existing properties` section. Use this
section to make any comments about the data collection or project that you would
like the data curators to know about. Comments will not be finalized until you
hit the `Submit` button, and they will be lost if you navigate away from the 
data collection that you are modifying before doing this.

### Submitting requests
Once you are done modifying your project or data collection, hit the `Submit`
button to send your requests to the database. You will be taken to a page that
displays a table with the change requests that you have submitted so far. There
is a `Search` bar where you can search for changes that you have requested so
far. At the bottom of the page, you can select various options to export and 
download the table that is currently displayed in your preferred format. 
Once you are done using this page, you can select the `Submit more suggestions`
button to return to the starting page, or press your browser's back button to 
return to the previous page.
