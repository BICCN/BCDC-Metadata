Transgenic or viral strategies were used to label specific cell populations in the brain with fluorescent reporters. Sample collection was biased to enable sampling of as many cell types as possible and reduce redundant cell type collection. Most of the cells in this dataset were collected using broad Cre-driver lines that labeled all neurons (Snap25-IRES2-Cre), all Glutamatergic cells (Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre), or all GABAergic cells (Slc32a1-IRES-Cre or Gad2-IRES-Cre). Cells from primary visual cortex (VISp) and anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM, a subset of secondary motor cortex, MOs) were collected from a broad set of transgenic driver and reporter combinations in addition to the broad lines specified above. Fine dissections of brain regions and cortical layers were performed and tracked throughout sample processing. Specimens were dissected from both hemispheres in both male and female mice. Fluorescence activated s+J10orting of cells was performed based on expression or absence of fluorescent reporter labels to isolate individual cells into separate tubes. Isolated cells were processed for single cell RNA sequencing using SMARTer v4. This method enables tracking of dissection location and high gene detection per cell to identify fine differences in gene expression and highly selective marker genes. This dataset will survey all major regions of the mouse brain. Publication: Tasic, B. et al. Nature 563, 72;78 (2018)."

However, studies of the epigenomic landscape of the developing human brain have yet to be performed at single-cell resolution. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility of >75,000 cells from eight distinct areas of developing human forebrain using single cell ATAC-seq (scATACseq). We identified thousands of loci that undergo extensive cell type-specific changes in accessibility during corticogenesis. Chromatin state profiling also reveals novel distinctions between neural progenitor cells from different cortical areas not seen in transcriptomic profiles and suggests a role for retinoic acid signaling in cortical arealization. Comparison of the cell type-specific chromatin landscape of cerebral organoids to primary developing cortex found that organoids establish broad cell type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns similar to the developing cortex, but lack many putative regulatory elements identified in homologous primary cell types. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development."

Within the brain, the cerebral cortex is responsible for a number of cognitive functions and sensory integration, with distinct cortical regions controlling a variety of tasks including motion, vision, speech, and judgment. Recent work exploring the cell types of two distinct cortical regions in the human and mouse suggests that excitatory neurons are area specific and emerge during developmental stages of peak neurogenesis. However, further characterization of cortical arealization is required to understand whether gradients, sharp boundaries, or some combination of patterns describes the areal distribution of neurons and other cortical cell types. Importantly, accurate modeling of cortical development and understanding biological constraints for any attempts at stem cell therapies requires characterizing when neuroepithelia or radial glia transition from a uniform population into areal specific progenitors, and the degree to which they are committed to an areal fate. In order to comprehensively characterize the areal diversity of cell types during human development, we performed single-cell sequencing of a variety of cortical regions and sub-cortical structures from 20 intact first and second trimester brain samples. With over a million cells, we identify hundreds of cells types including temporal and area specific neurons, interneurons and radial glia populations, as well as a number of subtypes from each of these classes that are expressed across most cortical areas. Additionally, we find a small number of subpopulations of neuroepithelial cells and identify several key pathways that may regulate the switch from neuroepithelia to radial glia identity. Together, these datasets suggest a model of both area restricted progenitor populations as well as radial glia cell types that are observed across cortical regions, suggesting an orchestrated interplay of fate determination that gives rise to the required cell diversity of the human cerebral cortex."

This incredibly complex process involves multiple interacting cell lineages and dynamic processes, such as neurogenesis and gliogenesis, neuronal migration, cell differentiation, areal specification, axon outgrowth and synapse formation and maturation. Human cortical development proceeds through a number of critical stages that are believed to be affected in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In order to investigate the dynamic landscape of human cortical development at the single-cell resolution, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile more than 100 post-mortem human cortical tissue samples from over 50 individuals and three cortical areas. We included samples ranging from second and third trimesters of prenatal development though neonatal and early postnatal stages to teenage and early adult years. By using unbiased nuclei isolation coupled with droplet-based single-cell profiling (10x Genomics), we generated over 300,000 single-nucleus transcriptomics profiles. We performed unbiased clustering, marker discovery and trajectory analysis, and were able to discover gene expression programs that underlie generation of subtypes of cortical projection neurons, interneurons and glial cell types, as well as critical process of development, such as generation of astrocytes, axon outgrowth, synapse formation and formation of mature cortical neuronal circuits. By intersecting cell type-specific developmental gene expression profiles with known genetic risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders, we were able to identify cell types and developmental stages that can be especially affected in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, leading to improper formation and function of specific cortical circuits. Our study sheds light on cell type-specific mechanisms of normal cortical development and cell types and processes affected in common neurodevelopmental disease. In addition, our rich single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas will be of great value to a wide range of neuroscientists."

Here we propose a novel approach to classify neuronal cell types by brainwide comprehensive profiling of the dendritic morphology of genetically-defined neurons in the mouse brain. We have developed an innovative mouse genetic tool, called Mosaicism with Repeat Frameshift (or MORF), which enables sparsely and stochastically labeling of genetically-defined neurons in mice. MORF reporter mice can label in exquisite detail single neurons from dendrite and spines to axons and axonal terminals at a labeling frequency of 1-5% of a given neuronal population. We propose to cross our new MORF lines with Cre mouse lines for striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of direct- and indirect pathways, and for cortical pyramidal neurons of distinct cortical layers (i.e. L2/3/4, L5 and L6). Each MORF/Cre mouse will allow us to image the detailed dendritic morphology for thousands of genetically-defined striatal and cortical neurons (i.e. dendritome). We have also developed and streamlined imaging and computational tools to acquire and register brainwide single neuron morphological data onto a standard reference mouse brain atlas. We will digitally reconstruct hundreds of thousands of MORF-labeled neurons using our novel program called G-Cut. Reconstructed neurons will subsequently used for morphology based clustering to define new morphological subtypes, which in turn can be analyzed for the expression of novel molecular markers neuronal cell types (e.g. from single cell RNA-sequencing).  Finally, we will disseminate the data to the Brain Cell Data Center (BCDC) for data integration with those from other BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and for data access by the broader neuroscience research community.

Single cell full morphology provides precise information for projection, correlation between dendrite and axon topology and functions. However, how to produce large-scale 3D full morphology is a major challenge. We developed a strict leveled protocol combined with automatic and manual procedures to systematically guide the neuron reconstruction process with clear standards. We reconstructed more than 1000 neurons located in thalamus, striatum, claustrum, etc. based on our protocol. Reconstructions of thalamus are grouped to sensory relay nuclei like VP, LGN, MG, VL etc. and higher order nuclei like PO, RT, etc. Strikingly, multiple axon clusters of single neuron present layer specific projections and highlights the projection which have been overlooked in population level, like VPM projecting to secondary sensory cortex. Axonal branching patterns are with different characteristics from different nuclei, like Neurons located in Reticular nucleus display netting pattern. Importantly, soma location, dendritic structure and axonal projection could be tightly correlated for specific neurons like neurons located nearby border of PO and VPM. Also, single cell could supply more accurate intracellular connectivity compared to population level."
