To characterize the cell type-specificty of the enhancers reporter mice were injected the AAV. Virus-infected cells were isolated from the brain by fluorescence activated sorting of cells was performed based on expression of fluorescent reporter labels and sorted into into separate tubes. Isolated cells were processed for single cell RNA sequencing using SMARTer v4. This method enables tracking of dissection location and high gene detection per cell to identify fine differences in gene expression and highly selective marker genes.,open,in progress,2021/12/23
