BICAN,BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network,BICAN,"NIH's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative - Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) consists of a group of large-scale Comprehensive Centers that will adopt scalable technology platforms and streamlined sampling strategies and assay cascade to create comprehensive and highly granular brain cell atlases of human and non-human primates with an emphasis on human. The Centers will characterize all brain cell types (neurons, glia, and other non-neuronal cells) at high-resolution. The overarching goal of the BICAN is to build reference brain cell atlases that will be widely used throughout the research community, providing a molecular and anatomical foundational framework for the study of brain function and disorders.",program,,,
BICCN,BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network,BICCN,"NIH's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative - Cell Census Network (BICCN) aims to provide researchers and the public with a comprehensive reference of the diverse cell types in human, mouse, and non-human primate brain. A network of integrated centers and laboratories including U01, RF1, and U19 data generating centers, R24 data archives, and a U24 Brain Cell Data Center (BCDC) are working collaboratively to generate, map, and share these data with the community.",program,,,https://www.biccn.org/
ACTD,Allen Cell Types Database,Allen Cell Types Database,"The goal of the Allen Cell Types Database is to characterize, in a systematic and standardized manner, individual neurons in neocortical and thalamic regions of the mouse and adult human brain. This characterization includes: intrinsic electrophysiology properties, neuron morphology, transcriptomics profile, and/or parameters from multiple computational models incorporating one  or more of these experimentally defined modalities. Through clustering and correlational  analyses  of these different modalities, we seek to characterize neuronal cell types, and to enable cross-species comparison.",sub program,,,https://celltypes.brain-map.org/
BICAN BCDC,A Community Resource for Single Cell Data in the Brain_,BICAN BRAIN Cell Data Center,"The BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) will generate comprehensive molecular taxonomies and organizational principles of cell type diversity in the human and non-human primate extending comprehensive BICCN work in the mouse. This detailed census of the structure and role of cell type specific data in the brain is recognized as one of the most promising avenues for advancing our understanding of the human brain in health and disease. To facilitate successful operations for BICAN, this project will establish an engagement, outreach, and coordination unit for the consortium that will manage operations, essential standards development and documentation, provide operational transparency, and identify and coordinate solutions to key hurdles for collaboration and analysis. In addition to organizing virtual and in-person meetings of the BICAN network and working groups this unit will improve interoperability and alignment with other consortia and partners and aim to improve usage for a wide range of potential data consumers. Complementing these fundamental operational goals of the BICAN consortium and partner CUBIE units, this unit will provide a governance structure for generation and operational transparency of BICAN data production and release and standards development. Essential activities will include technical management and facilitation of community standards, schemas, and ontology development, and centralized consortium data registration and dashboard, and coordinating and organizing BICAN outreach, training, and education activities to enhance interactions with external research programs and consortia. The resulting consortium generated data and tools will be made publicly accessible in a community portal supporting data retrieval, consortium activities, amplify public impact through strong BICAN partnership management, communication, standards committees, and analysis working groups, and develop infrastructure for maximizing community usage, publishing standards and tutorials, and coordinating education and outreach.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10521124
BICAN Dev Human NHP,A Multidisciplinary Center for Developing Human and Non-human Primate Brain Cell Atlases,BICAN Developing Human NHP,"The ultimate product of our Center will be a series of comprehensive developing human and non-human primate (NHP) brain atlases of unprecedented cellular, spatial, and anatomical resolution. In Aim 1, we will characterize transient cell populations, establish the diversity of cell types present in specific brain regions, unravel complex developmental trajectories, and reveal conserved and divergent cell-type specific features. We will jointly profile of single nucleus RNA (snRNA-seq) and accessible chromatin (snATAC-seq) using the 10X Genomics snMultiome platform. All aims will include 30 anatomically distinct regions of fresh frozen developing human, rhesus macaque, and marmoset brains at four developmental epochs: mid-gestation, neonatal, childhood, and adolescence and perform probe-based validation. In Aim 2, we will conduct spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic mapping of cell types in fresh-frozen developing human and NHP brains using DBiT spatial-RNA-seq and spatial-ATAC-seq platforms. This approach will allow us to discover spatial and temporal features, including the developmental niche, proximity of cell types to each other, and regional abundance. In Aim 3 we will create Common Coordinate Frameworks for the developing human and NHP brain using high resolution (9.4T and 7T) MRI-based developmental structural atlases and leveraging existing developing human MRI data. Our final aim will create a cross species molecular and spatial atlas of brain development in human and NHP. This integration will enable us to identify conserved and diveregent aspects of the human brain and identify the developmental stages, spatial distribution, gene regulatory elements and cell types vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We will coordinate to ensure that our developmental atlases merge with adult human, macaque and marmoset atlases that other BICAN centers create. The data collected by our Center will be perfectly aligned with the overarching goal of the BICCN in generating a comprehensive census of brain cell types across the lifespan that integrates molecular, anatomical, functional, and cell lineage data for describing cell types in human and NHP brains. By leveraging innovations in cell capture and spatial mapping technologies, the current proposal will have broad implications for understanding the cellular origins of diseases and for highlighting patterns of selective cell type vulnerability in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Additionally, our plans to create developmental cellular and molecular resolution maps of marmoset and macaque will provide foundational data for establishing primate models of human disease. Finally, our atlas of conserved molecular, epigenetic, and spatial properties will support the precise monitoring, targeting, and replacement of specific cell types and the improvement of in vitro models.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10523935
BICAN Dev Mouse,Comprehensive single-cell atlas of the developing mouse brain,BICAN Developing Mouse Atlas,"The developing mouse brain is a foundational experimental model for investigation of the origins of cell types in the mammalian brain. Comprehensive knowledge of mouse brain development is critical for comparative studies of neurodevelopmental processes, which are key to understanding the remarkable evolutionary innovations that distinguish humans from other species. In addition, developmental information enables refining cell taxonomy in the adult brain by incorporating knowledge of cell type and lineage origins into adult cell classification. Despite the transformative insights enabled by the recently created molecular atlas of the adult mouse brain, we currently lack a comprehensive census of cell types of the developing mouse brain, and the lineage relationships that link them to their adult counterparts. Here we seek to generate a comprehensive, spatially- and temporally-resolved, cellular-resolution atlas of the whole developing mouse brain, sampled at high resolution through the entire period of embryonic and postnatal brain development (from E8.0 to P28). We will employ three complementary approaches to generate comprehensive multi-omic single-cell profiles: 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), 10x Genomics Multiome (simultaneous single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, for combined transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling), and Smart-seq3 (for full-length deep RNA-sequencing). In parallel, we will use the spatially resolved transcriptomic method MERFISH across the same densely-sampled timeline, to identify the spatial distribution of all cell types and dynamic changes in cell states across the entire mouse brain. We will apply computational methods to predict developmental lineage relationships from these spatially and temporally resolved datasets, and experimentally validate lineage relationships through both barcode-based in vivo lineage tracing and by functionally testing candidate molecular effectors using multiplexed in utero CRISPR screening (Perturb-seq). Finally, we will pilot integration of developmental datasets across species, mapping single-cell omics datasets from the developing human and non-human primate brains onto the comprehensive mouse brain developing cell type atlas established here, to create a computational alignment of developmental time that will enable understanding of differential regulation of specific developmental events across species. Overall, this project brings together a team of investigators with extensive, demonstrated expertise in brain development, circuitry, single-cell genomics, and assembly of brain atlases to produce a comprehensive developmental brain cell atlas, intended to serve as a first-of-its-kind foundational resource to the neuroscience community for the study of mechanisms of mammalian brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders. Our proposed project will contribute substantially to the overarching goal of BICAN to generate fundamental knowledge on diverse cell types and their three-dimensional organizational principles in the brain across lifespan and evolution.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10523550
BICAN Dev Multiomics,Spatiotemporal epigenomic and chromosomal architectural cell atlas of developing human brains,BICAN Developmental Multiomics,"The adult human brain is comprised of numerous cell types exhibiting specific transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures associated with their spatial location, connectivity, and function. Although systematic efforts are underway to characterize cell types in the adult human brain, the transitional cell types and cell states in developing human brains are not fully defined. Our project will use epigenomic and three-dimensional (3D) chromosomal architectural information to classify developmental cell types and identify key regulatory dynamics that may underlie cellular lineage commitment and maturation. Single-cell DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility profiles have been successfully used to de novo identify distinct cell types in developing and adult brains. The single-nucleus joint profiling of DNA methylation and chromatin conformation by sn-m3C-seq provides unique information to identify enhancer-gene looping and provides a resource to link genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders to genes. Cell types identified with epigenomic information will be integrated with transcriptomic signatures using our innovative single-cell joint profiling method of transcriptome and DNA methylation snmCT-seq. We will apply state-of-the-art approaches to integrate multiple data modalities to identify progenitor and transitional cell types, lineage-specific regulatory elements, and enhancer-gene 3D interactions. We will construct cell-type- specific predictive models of cellular trajectory and gene regulation during brain development by integrating transcription factor-gene interaction information with time- and pseudotime-series genomics data. The cell type and regulatory elements catalog of human brain development generated by our project will aid the identification of developing brain cell types involved in neuropsychiatric disorders and regulatory regions susceptible to perturbation by disease-associated variants.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10523974
BICAN Knowledgebase,An extensible brain knowledge base and toolset spanning modalities for multi-species data-driven cell types_,BICAN Knowledgebase,"BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) is completing a comprehensive cell census of the adult mouse brain, and BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) will extend this work with emphasis on human and non- human primates. Effectively organizing, summarizing, accessing, and refining these atlases is critical to maximizing their impact on science. This proposal is to develop an extensible Brain Cell Knowledge Base (BCKB) to ingest and standardize comprehensive cell type information from BICAN’s development of a multimodal, multi-species brain cell atlas and disseminate that atlas as an open and interactive community resource for advancing knowledge of the brain. The BCKB will be initialized during this project with multi- dimensional brain cell type classifications from BICCN and will expand as data and knowledge are produced by BICAN researchers. Under Aim 1, we will create an adaptive knowledge graph for linking brain cell information. Spatial aggregation will be done using common coordinate frameworks. A flexible graph-based data model will capture discrete and continuous cell type relationships. The work will start with cross-species MOp data and comprehensive whole- brain mouse datasets from BICCN and later extend into BICAN’s whole-brain molecular and spatial transcriptomics data in human and non-human primates as such data becomes available. Anchoring of taxonomies in single cell molecular and spatial transcriptomics provides a robust framework for integrating multimodal data that is spatially mapped and/or cell types mapped. An ecosystem of tools for curating, annotating, mapping, and visualization of cell type data will be created in Aim 2. We will build and extend tools, such as the initial Cell Types Cards showcasing BICCN’s MOp results, so BICAN teams and public labs can share and refine brain cell type taxonomies and anatomical integration. The tools framework developed for this aim will provide a central hub, akin to an “app store,” to access our tools and others from the community to interact with cell type data. This connected tools framework will streamline scientific workflows and encourage FAIR practices. As part of Aim 3, we will develop an infrastructure to link brain cell data and knowledge. This infrastructure will enable ingesting, storing, searching, and curating neuroscientific information from multiple sources into a linked information platform. This knowledge infrastructure will help connect disparate pieces of cell type information using expert annotations, machine-learning inferences, and derivations using provenance mechanisms. We will use Allen Institute’s Brain Knowledge Platform for initial implementation. Finally, in Aim 4 we will gather, curate, and integrate information and knowledge from BICAN teams by conducting annual hands- on training and feedback workshops. These events will create engagement within and outside BICAN projects and foster community-based evolution, sustainability, and governance.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10520941
BICAN Mol Pipelines,Scalable Molecular Pipelines for FAIR and Reusable BICAN Molecular Data_,BICAN Molecular Pipelines,"This project will create scalable resources that will be critical to the development of BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) consortium brain atlases. This team will focus on the development of common molecular data processing pipelines that are cloud-native and FAIR. Starting with an already established portfolio of BICCN pipelines and community relationships developed in previous funding, this portfolio will be updated and extended in collaboration with the BICAN community. Leveraging and improving existing integration between the BICCN molecular (NeMO) archive and cloud-computing environment (Terra), this team will process data sets, prioritized by the BICAN community and in support of joint analysis for atlas building. These pipelines will produce data with a comprehensive panel of metrics that our team will leverage to perform quality control and assure rigor in data processing and use. This team will work with analysis groups to confirm outputs of the pipelines are compatible with downstream analysis and are extended to incorporate critical downstream steps as they mature and are agreed upon by the BICAN community. The cloud computing environment used by this team will be open and available to the BICAN community and supported by a helpdesk, documentation, forums, and an annual workshop. As this infrastructure spans institutes, Terra is currently enabling BICCN working groups to share cloud resources and jointly analyze data in a common scalable space; this will continue to be true in the BICAN community. To enable visualizing, sharing and publishing of data, this team brings cloud programming environments (Terra), specialized scalable resources (Cirrocumulus, Pegasus), and publication portals (NeMO Analytics, and the Single Cell Portal) to be leveraged in consortium activities. These common resources will be critical to enable the BICAN community to come together and perform analysis that scales to the needs of BICAN atlas building efforts.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10523659
BICAN Mul PN Human,Center for Multiomic Human Brain Cell Atlas,BICAN Multiome Postnatal Human," Understanding cell identities and their spatial distributions throughout different regions of the human brain is a fundamental step when trying to integrate physiological, behavioral, neurochemical and molecular data. At present, although major categories of the cell-types present in the human brain have been defined molecularly, the different subtypes within these categories along with their locations are far from understood. Gene expression drives cell programs and states that underlie distinct brain functions. Open chromatin and modified histones mark gene-regulatory elements that control cell type-specific gene expression patterns. Cytosine DNA methylation (mC) is a stable epigenomic signature that persists in post-mitotic cells throughout their lifetime, defining their cellular identity. Single-cell gene expression, open chromatin profiles and DNA methylation assays have been successfully used to identify distinct cell types in an unbiased fashion in heterogeneous tissues including the human brain. This UM1 proposal builds on our earlier successes in mouse brain mapping to produce detailed single-cell multimomic and spatial cell maps at the single-cell level across 100 anatomically defined regions in the human brain. Profiling human brain samples will permit the discovery of unique gene expression patterns for each molecularly-defined cell type, identify their spatial organization, and their specific non-coding DNA regulatory regions. Multi-modal integration between epigenomic and transcriptomic signatures will allow the identification of new cell types and unique cell-type markers that will rapidly be made available to the entire community. This UM1 project will also provide new tools for genetic access of previously inaccessible brain regions as well as facilitate the functional analysis of genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10523973
BICAN PN Human Var,An Atlas of Human Brain Cell Variation,BICAN PN Human Variation,"The human brain exhibits profound diversity in biological function and vulnerability to disease. Despite the biomedical and cultural importance of inter-individual variation, we know relatively little about its underlying cellular and molecular substrates. In this work we will leverage new technologies in single-cell and spatial genomics to construct an Atlas of Human Brain Cell Variation. We will analyze tens of millions of cells from more than 200 people by single-nucleus RNA-seq and single-nucleus ATAC-seq, and a subset of these by spatial transcriptomics. Analysis of these data will seek to understand: the static versus dynamic molecular and spatial features of each cell type; the ways in which human genetic variation shapes the molecular repertoire of each cell type; and the constellations of cellular and molecular features that co-vary, appearing together in the same brains. We seek especially with this work to understand the functional connections between these phenotypes and: (i) the gene regulatory processes that drive and shape it; (ii) genetic variation associated with brain diseases; and (iii) structural brain variation measured in hundreds of neuroimaging studies. The project will deliver an essential data resource for cellular, molecular, genetic and translational neuroscience – while expanding our understanding of the ways the human brain varies across different people.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10523654
BICAN V1 Functional,"Bridging Function, Connectivity, and Transcriptomics of Mouse Cortical Neurons",BICAN V1 Functional Atlas,"This project seeks to elucidate the concept of the brain cell type and its relation to the brain architecture and function, by establishing links between molecular and anatomical cell types, circuit connectivity, and functional neural activity in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We will record activity of neurons, use multiplexed fluorescence in-situ hybridization (mFISH) to identify their cell types as defined by gene expression, analyze neuronal morphologies and connectivity using Electron Microscopy (EM) reconstruction of the V1 circuit, and release the resulting data and knowledge as a free atlas for the community. The findings and data from this project will serve as foundational resources for future scientific studies and biomedical applications aiming to leverage the relations between brain cell types, circuit structure, and its function.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10519964
CUBIE Specimen,Engagement through specimen and sequencing tracking portals,Specimen & sequencing portals,"As a part of BRAIN 2.0, the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) is expected to advance fundamental knowledge and enabling technology for classifying human brain cell types, understanding their organizational principles, and providing open-access digital brain cell reference atlases, emphasizing cell diversity in health and disease. Undertaking the grand challenge of BRAIN 2.0 requires the scientific community to collaborate and tap the tremendous skill and knowledge in a diverse set of disciplines outside of neuroscience. BICAN's Coordinating Unit for Biostatistics, Informatics, and Engagement (CUBIE) is designed to provide effective coordination benefits to the awardee network, the NIH, and the scientific community. Advancing the ambitious BICAN goals requires CUBIE to anticipate and address potential challenges in coordinating time-sensitive management activities, mitigating data complexity and tool scalability, and supporting diverse service needs. Our team is highly experienced in leading large consortia projects at national scale and we have the knowledge, skill set, and resources to launch the Engagement and Outreach element for CUBIE (CUBIE4) and work with the BICAN network in taming the structural and organizational complexity of data and driving a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data ecosystem through three specific components. The Specimen Portal is the most upstream system for BICAN which uses a common-data-modeled database to systematically link BICAN tissue resources prospectively to set the stage for achieving anatomical precision using CCFs longer term. The Specimen Portal will facilitate an environment which supports various activities regarding BICAN human specimens. It provides functionality for data capturing, dashboarding, linking to external data archives, specimen exploration, and specimen requesting and tracking. The Sequence Tracking Portal will serve as a nexus linking the data generation pipeline from tissue preparation by investigators to processing by sequencing centers and deposition of fastq files to NeMO. This will be a highly coordinated and collaborative effort that will facilitate sequencing data and metadata management for a variety of stakeholders. The data model and ontology component will engage the BICAN research network to standardize library metadata and extract common LIMS data models, as well as serving as a bridge to link BICAN terminology resources to external ontologies in general. We contribute to diversity in multidisciplinary knowledge, women and early-career investigators, neurological diseases and brain health perspectives, and institutional inclusivity resources. Therefore, the CUBIE4 team is uniquely well-positioned to advance the overarching goals of BICAN.",sub program,,,https://brain-specimenportal.org
HMBA,Human and Mammalian Brain Atlas,HMBA,"The Human and Mammalian Brain Atlas (HMBA) consortium aims to create new whole brain human and non-human primate cell atlases linked to functional brain architecture. Single cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomics will be used to classify and spatially map cell types across the entire human, macaque and marmoset brain, sampling based on brain maps derived from structural and functional imaging, with additional targeted analyses to understand variation across human individuals and a broader range of mammalian species. Molecularly defined cell types will be characterized for cellular anatomy and physiology, using enhancer-AAV based tools to allow selective genetic labeling of cell types where possible. The outcome of these efforts will produce a new reference classification for cell types across the whole human and NHP brain, spatial maps of molecularly defined cell types, and phenotypic characterization of fundamental brain cell types, all aligned in common coordinate frameworks. This effort will create new multiscale, high resolution brain atlases integrating structural, functional, cellular and molecular information between human and non-human primate and rodent model organisms.",sub program,,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10523848

ABCA_proj,Whole Mouse Brain Transcriptomic Cell Type Atlas,ABC Atlas - Whole Mouse Brain,"The Whole Mouse Brain Atlas is a high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas across the entire mouse brain, integrating several whole-brain single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. The datasets contain a total of ~4 million cells passing rigorous quality-control (QC) criteria. The integrated transcriptomic taxonomy contains 5,322 clusters that are organized in a hierarchical manner with nested groupings of 34 classes, 338 subclasses, 1,201 supertypes and 5,322 types/clusters. The scRNA-seq data reveal transcriptome-wide gene expression and co-expression patterns for each cell type. The anatomical location of each cell type has been annotated using a comprehensive brain-wide MERFISH dataset with a total of ~4 million segmented and QC-passed cells, probed with a 500-gene panel and registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3). The MERFISH data not only provide accurate spatial annotation of cell types at subclass, supertype and cluster levels, but also reveal fine-resolution spatial distinctions or gradients for cell types. The combination of scRNA-seq and MERFISH data reveals a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type, as well as unique features of cell type organization in different brain regions. A detailed cell type annotation table is also provided along with data downloads (GitHub), providing information about the hierarchical membership, anatomical annotation, neurotransmitter type, cell type marker genes, transcription factor and neuropeptide markers, and other metadata types for each cluster.",data collection project,,"Primary publication: Yao et al.

Comprehensive knowledge of mouse brain development is critical for comparative studies of neurodevelopmental processes, which are key to understanding the remarkable evolutionary innovations that distinguish humans from other species. In addition, developmental information enables refining cell taxonomy in the adult brain by incorporating knowledge of cell type and lineage origins into adult cell classification. Despite the transformative insights enabled by the recently created molecular atlas of the adult mouse brain, we currently lack a comprehensive census of cell types of the developing mouse brain, and the lineage relationships that link them to their adult counterparts. Here we seek to generate a comprehensive, spatially- and temporally-resolved, cellular-resolution atlas of the whole developing mouse brain, sampled at high resolution through the entire period of embryonic and postnatal brain development (from E8.0 to P28). We will employ three complementary approaches to generate comprehensive multi-omic single-cell profiles: 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), 10x Genomics Multiome (simultaneous single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, for combined transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling), and Smart-seq3 (for full-length deep RNA-sequencing). In parallel, we will use the spatially resolved transcriptomic method MERFISH across the same densely-sampled timeline, to identify the spatial distribution of all cell types and dynamic changes in cell states across the entire mouse brain. We will apply computational methods to predict developmental lineage relationships from these spatially and temporally resolved datasets, and experimentally validate lineage relationships through both barcode-based in vivo lineage tracing and by functionally testing candidate molecular effectors using multiplexed in utero CRISPR screening (Perturb-seq). Finally, we will pilot integration of developmental datasets across species, mapping single-cell omics datasets from the developing human and non-human primate brains onto the comprehensive mouse brain developing cell type atlas established here, to create a computational alignment of developmental time that will enable understanding of differential regulation of specific developmental events across species. Overall, this project brings together a team of investigators with extensive, demonstrated expertise in brain development, circuitry, single-cell genomics, and assembly of brain atlases to produce a comprehensive developmental brain cell atlas, intended to serve as a first-of-its-kind foundational resource to the neuroscience community for the study of mechanisms of mammalian brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders. Our proposed project will contribute substantially to the overarching goal of BICAN to generate fundamental knowledge on diverse cell types and their three-dimensional organizational principles in the brain across lifespan and evolution.",data collection project,,,

chung_antibody_proj,"Highly specific, renewable, and cost-effective antibody toolbox for 3D proteomic phenotyping of the brain",Antibody toolbox,"System-wide analysis of cell types in the brain is essential for understanding how complex cellular interactions give rise to various brain functions. Rapidly evolving tissue transformation and clearing technologies have enabled three-dimensional (3D) imaging and phenotyping of intact brains at unprecedented resolution. In particular, proteomic imaging techniques can provide multiscale anatomical, morphological, molecular, and functional information in both non-human and human brains. Highly specific antibodies, once rigorously validated, should enable spatial mapping of the brain proteome and corresponding cellular architectures; however, the unique potential of the 3D proteomic imaging is fundamentally limited by (1) incompatibility of existing antibodies with the emerging tissue transformation approaches, (2) poor specificity of commercially available antibodies, (3) lack of antibodies for newly identified targets, and (4) prohibitively high antibody cost for brain-wide labeling applications. The goal of this project is to democratize the 3D proteomic imaging approaches by creating a comprehensive open-source library of high-quality monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are truly renewable, scalable, and compatible with a wide range of conventional and emerging tissue processing technologies. In addition, we will develop robust and scalable protocols for uniform staining of intact brain tissues with new mAb tools. We envision that this antibody library and protocols will allow the research community to interrogate brain structure and function, including complex intercellular relationships at multiple scales.",data collection project,,,

dev_mouse_brain_ccf_proj,Developing Mouse Brain Imaging and Common Coordinate Framework,Dev Mouse Brain Imaging & CCF,"Brain development is characterized by a diverse set of cell types that are born and connected into rapidly growing, complex 3D structures across time. Quantitative understanding of cell type composition and distribution in different brain regions provides fundamental knowledge about the building blocks of the brain and serves as an essential baseline with which to assess changes that may occur in brain disorders. Common coordinate frameworks (CCF) provide an essential spatial context with which to understand cell type composition and 3D arrangement in the mouse brain. For the adult mouse brain, the Allen CCF currently serves as a standard atlas resource with which to map and integrate results from different studies. On the other hand, the lack of CCFs in developing mouse brains significantly impedes progress on quantitative spatiotemporal understanding of cell types during neurodevelopment. To address this deficiency, we have assembled a highly synergistic, multi-institutional team with complementary skill sets to create developmental CCFs with associated ontology and true 3D anatomical labels while also demonstrating the application of our CCFs by generating quantitative mappings of GABAergic neurons in the developing mouse brain. Toward this end, we will first utilize MRI and light sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) to develop high-resolution developmental CCFs at seven different developmental time points (E11.5, E13.5, E15.5, E18.5, P4, P14, and P56) with different cellular features highlighted, including total cell density, myelination, and neurovasculature. Second, we will create fully3D anatomical labels for the CCFs based on cellular and gene expression information, and build a comprehensive ontology that will allow anatomical region changes to be linked across development and maturation. Lastly, we will generate a cellular-resolution quantitative map of GABAergic neuronal subtypes using tissue clearing and LSFM imaging in developing mouse brains. The successful completion of this project will enable a broad field of scientists to leverage modern brain mapping technologies more effectively in studying the developing mouse brain.",data collection project,,,

kriegstein_sc_10x_proj,Single-Cell Sequencing of the Developing Human Brain,10x 3' v2 and v3 sequencing,"The human brain is composed of diverse cell types across brain regions that enable unique capabilities. Within the brain, the cerebral cortex is responsible for a number of cognitive functions and sensory integration, with distinct cortical regions controlling a variety of tasks including motion, vision, speech, and judgment. Recent work exploring the cell types of two distinct cortical regions in the human and mouse suggests that excitatory neurons are area specific and emerge during developmental stages of peak neurogenesis. However, further characterization of cortical arealization is required to understand whether gradients, sharp boundaries, or some combination of patterns describes the areal distribution of neurons and other cortical cell types. Importantly, accurate modeling of cortical development and understanding biological constraints for any attempts at stem cell therapies requires characterizing when neuroepithelia or radial glia transition from a uniform population into areal specific progenitors, and the degree to which they are committed to an areal fate. In order to comprehensively characterize the areal diversity of cell types during human development, we performed single-cell sequencing of a variety of cortical regions and sub-cortical structures from 20 intact first and second trimester brain samples. With over a million cells, we identify hundreds of cells types including temporal and area specific neurons, interneurons and radial glia populations, as well as a number of subtypes from each of these classes that are expressed across most cortical areas. Additionally, we find a small number of subpopulations of neuroepithelial cells and identify several key pathways that may regulate the switch from neuroepithelia to radial glia identity. Together, these datasets suggest a model of both area restricted progenitor populations as well as radial glia cell types that are observed across cortical regions, suggesting an orchestrated interplay of fate determination that gives rise to the required cell diversity of the human cerebral cortex.",data collection project,,"Dataset: Aparna Bhaduri, Neel Parikshak, Li Wang, Arnold Kriegstein (2021) Single-Cell Sequencing of the Developing Human Brain: 10x 3' v3 sequencing [Dataset].

Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility of >75,000 cells from eight distinct areas of developing human forebrain using single cell ATAC-seq (scATACseq). We identified thousands of loci that undergo extensive cell type-specific changes in accessibility during corticogenesis. Chromatin state profiling also reveals novel distinctions between neural progenitor cells from different cortical areas not seen in transcriptomic profiles and suggests a role for retinoic acid signaling in cortical arealization. Comparison of the cell type-specific chromatin landscape of cerebral organoids to primary developing cortex found that organoids establish broad cell type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns similar to the developing cortex, but lack many putative regulatory elements identified in homologous primary cell types.

kriegstein_sn_10x_proj,Single-Nuclei Sequencing of Late Stages of Human Brain Development and Early Postnatal Life,10x 3' v2 sequencing,"Human cortical development spans years of prenatal and postnatal development. This incredibly complex process involves multiple interacting cell lineages and dynamic processes, such as neurogenesis and gliogenesis, neuronal migration, cell differentiation, areal specification, axon outgrowth and synapse formation and maturation. Human cortical development proceeds through a number of critical stages that are believed to be affected in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In order to investigate the dynamic landscape of human cortical development at the single-cell resolution, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile more than 100 post-mortem human cortical tissue samples from over 50 individuals and three cortical areas. We included samples ranging from second and third trimesters of prenatal development though neonatal and early postnatal stages to teenage and early adult years. By using unbiased nuclei isolation coupled with droplet-based single-cell profiling (10x Genomics), we generated over 300,000 single-nucleus transcriptomics profiles. We performed unbiased clustering, marker discovery and trajectory analysis, and were able to discover gene expression programs that underlie generation of subtypes of cortical projection neurons, interneurons and glial cell types, as well as critical process of development, such as generation of astrocytes, axon outgrowth, synapse formation and formation of mature cortical neuronal circuits. By intersecting cell type-specific developmental gene expression profiles with known genetic risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders, we were able to identify cell types and developmental stages that can be especially affected in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, leading to improper formation and function of specific cortical circuits. Our study sheds light on cell type-specific mechanisms of normal cortical development and cell types and processes affected in common neurodevelopmental disease. In addition, our rich single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas will be of great value to a wide range of neuroscientists.",data collection project,,"Dataset:  Dmitry Velmeshev, Arnold Kriegstein (2021) Single-Nuclei Sequencing of Late Stages of Human Brain Development and Early Postnatal Life [Dataset].

The first aim of the project is to generate high resolution, single cell epigenetic and transcriptional atlases of one male and one female rhesus macaque brain by profiling chromatin accessibility in 750,000 nuclei (sci-ATAC-seq) and transcription in 1,500,000 nuclei (sci-RNA-seq) from each of two macaque brains (for a total of 4.5 million cells).

yang_MORF_confocal_proj,Dendritome mapping of genetically-defined and sparsely-labeled cortical and striatal projection neurons,Dendritome mapping,"Integrating molecular, morphological, and connectomic properties is critical for unbiased classification of neuronal cell types in the mammalian brain. Here we propose a novel approach to classify neuronal cell types by brainwide comprehensive profiling of the dendritic morphology of genetically-defined neurons in the mouse brain. We have developed an innovative mouse genetic tool, called Mosaicism with Repeat Frameshift (or MORF), which enables sparsely and stochastically labeling of genetically-defined neurons in mice. MORF reporter mice can label in exquisite detail single neurons from dendrite and spines to axons and axonal terminals at a labeling frequency of 1-5% of a given neuronal population. We propose to cross our new MORF lines with Cre mouse lines for striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of direct- and indirect pathways, and for cortical pyramidal neurons of distinct cortical layers (i.e. L2/3/4, L5 and L6). Each MORF/Cre mouse will allow us to image the detailed dendritic morphology for thousands of genetically-defined striatal and cortical neurons (i.e. dendritome). We have also developed and streamlined imaging and computational tools to acquire and register brainwide single neuron morphological data onto a standard reference mouse brain atlas. We will digitally reconstruct hundreds of thousands of MORF-labeled neurons using our novel program called G-Cut. Reconstructed neurons will subsequently used for morphology based clustering to define new morphological subtypes, which in turn can be analyzed for the expression of novel molecular markers neuronal cell types (e.g. from single cell RNA-sequencing).  Finally, we will disseminate the data to the Brain Cell Data Center (BCDC) for data integration with those from other BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and for data access by the broader neuroscience research community.

However, the number of cell types in VMHvl and their relationship to connectivity and behavioral function are unknown. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing using two independent platforms-SMART-seq(~4,500 neurons) and 10x (~78,000 neurons)-and investigated correspondence between transcriptomic identity and axonal projections (Retro-seq for SMART-seq) or behavioral activation (Act-seq for 10x), respectively. Canonical correlation analysis identified 17 transcriptomic types (T-types), including several sexually dimorphic clusters, the majority of which were validated by seqFISH.

Diverse neuronal cell types are organized through synaptic connections into neural circuits, with intricate wiring between nodes located at different circuit levels.

We will employ a pipeline that leverages enhanced non-diseased human brain collection capable of providing a non-limiting source of clinically validated, high quality brain tissue of matched ages and sex. Our pipeline will include: basic clinical information of non-brain diseased donors from which the post-mortem interval (PMI) will be limited to 24 hours or less; post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological examination to select brains that are not complicated by occult disease; rapid freezing to maintain neuroanatomical landmarks for spatial registration. The selected brains will be assayed by these three technologies producing transcriptome, accessibility, and spatial data at single cell resolution. Novel computational approaches will also be developed for scalable and efficient integration and analysis of data at these larger and more complex scales that will encompass all known cell types in the brain, not limited to neurons. We will systematically apply these methods to produce reference single-cell maps for female and male brains, extending to all 44 human Brodmann Areas (BAs) of the cerebral cortex as well as comprehensive sampling through subcortical divisions of adult brain, and construct a spatial multi-omic map of the human brain.",data collection project,,,

The cell atlas was spatially registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3), which allows systematic quantifications of the cell composition and organization in individual brain regions as anatomically delineated in the CCFv3.

The projections are specific and stereotypical - such that single glomeruli are formed by the projections of neurons expressing the same receptor gene and the spatial organization of these projections is highly reproducible from animal to animal across different receptor genes. It has been hypothesized that the 3D projection map of olfactory receptors converts molecular information into spatial organization, which is crucial for the coding and downstream processing of olfactory sensory information. Here we use the high throughput and sensitivity of MERFISH to identify the receptor mRNA molecules trafficked along the axons into the glomeruli structures in order to define their receptor identity.
