ABCA_proj,Mouse whole-brain transcriptomic cell type atlas,ABC Atlas - Mouse Whole Brain,"ABC Mouse Whole Brain Atlas is a transcriptomic cell-type taxonomy across the entire mouse brain, integrating several whole-brain single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. The datasets contain a total of ~4.5 million cells passing rigorous quality-control criteria. The integrated transcriptomic taxonomy contains 5206 clusters that are organized in a hierarchical manner with groupings of classes, subclasses, supertypes and types/clusters. The anatomical location of each cell type has been annotated by using comprehensive brain-wide MERFISH datasets with total of ~4 million cells.  The MERFISH datasets not only provide accurate spatial annotation of major cell types at subclass level, but also reveal very fine resolution spatial distinctions or gradients for cell types within each subclass.",data collection project,,,
chung_antibody_proj,"Highly specific, renewable, and cost-effective antibody toolbox for 3D proteomic phenotyping of the brain",Antibody toolbox,"System-wide analysis of cell types in the brain is essential for understanding how complex cellular interactions give rise to various brain functions. Rapidly evolving tissue transformation and clearing technologies have enabled three-dimensional (3D) imaging and phenotyping of intact brains at unprecedented resolution. In particular, proteomic imaging techniques can provide multiscale anatomical, morphological, molecular, and functional information in both non-human and human brains. Highly specific antibodies, once rigorously validated, should enable spatial mapping of the brain proteome and corresponding cellular architectures; however, the unique potential of the 3D proteomic imaging is fundamentally limited by (1) incompatibility of existing antibodies with the emerging tissue transformation approaches, (2) poor specificity of commercially available antibodies, (3) lack of antibodies for newly identified targets, and (4) prohibitively high antibody cost for brain-wide labeling applications. The goal of this project is to democratize the 3D proteomic imaging approaches by creating a comprehensive open-source library of high-quality monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are truly renewable, scalable, and compatible with a wide range of conventional and emerging tissue processing technologies. In addition, we will develop robust and scalable protocols for uniform staining of intact brain tissues with new mAb tools. We envision that this antibody library and protocols will allow the research community to interrogate brain structure and function, including complex intercellular relationships at multiple scales.",data collection project,,,

dev_mouse_brain_ccf_proj,Developing Mouse Brain Imaging and Common Coordinate Framework,Dev Mouse Brain Imaging & CCF,"Brain development is characterized by a diverse set of cell types that are born and connected into rapidly growing, complex 3D structures across time. Quantitative understanding of cell type composition and distribution in different brain regions provides fundamental knowledge about the building blocks of the brain and serves as an essential baseline with which to assess changes that may occur in brain disorders. Common coordinate frameworks (CCF) provide an essential spatial context with which to understand cell type composition and 3D arrangement in the mouse brain. For the adult mouse brain, the Allen CCF currently serves as a standard atlas resource with which to map and integrate results from different studies. On the other hand, the lack of CCFs in developing mouse brains significantly impedes progress on quantitative spatiotemporal understanding of cell types during neurodevelopment. To address this deficiency, we have assembled a highly synergistic, multi-institutional team with complementary skill sets to create developmental CCFs with associated ontology and true 3D anatomical labels while also demonstrating the application of our CCFs by generating quantitative mappings of GABAergic neurons in the developing mouse brain. Toward this end, we will first utilize MRI and light sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) to develop high-resolution developmental CCFs at seven different developmental time points (E11.5, E13.5, E15.5, E18.5, P4, P14, and P56) with different cellular features highlighted, including total cell density, myelination, and neurovasculature. Second, we will create fully3D anatomical labels for the CCFs based on cellular and gene expression information, and build a comprehensive ontology that will allow anatomical region changes to be linked across development and maturation. Lastly, we will generate a cellular-resolution quantitative map of GABAergic neuronal subtypes using tissue clearing and LSFM imaging in developing mouse brains. The successful completion of this project will enable a broad field of scientists to leverage modern brain mapping technologies more effectively in studying the developing mouse brain.",data collection project,,,

kriegstein_sc_10x_proj,Single-Cell Sequencing of the Developing Human Brain,10x 3' v2 and v3 sequencing,"The human brain is composed of diverse cell types across brain regions that enable unique capabilities. Within the brain, the cerebral cortex is responsible for a number of cognitive functions and sensory integration, with distinct cortical regions controlling a variety of tasks including motion, vision, speech, and judgment. Recent work exploring the cell types of two distinct cortical regions in the human and mouse suggests that excitatory neurons are area specific and emerge during developmental stages of peak neurogenesis. However, further characterization of cortical arealization is required to understand whether gradients, sharp boundaries, or some combination of patterns describes the areal distribution of neurons and other cortical cell types. Importantly, accurate modeling of cortical development and understanding biological constraints for any attempts at stem cell therapies requires characterizing when neuroepithelia or radial glia transition from a uniform population into areal specific progenitors, and the degree to which they are committed to an areal fate. In order to comprehensively characterize the areal diversity of cell types during human development, we performed single-cell sequencing of a variety of cortical regions and sub-cortical structures from 20 intact first and second trimester brain samples. With over a million cells, we identify hundreds of cells types including temporal and area specific neurons, interneurons and radial glia populations, as well as a number of subtypes from each of these classes that are expressed across most cortical areas. Additionally, we find a small number of subpopulations of neuroepithelial cells and identify several key pathways that may regulate the switch from neuroepithelia to radial glia identity. Together, these datasets suggest a model of both area restricted progenitor populations as well as radial glia cell types that are observed across cortical regions, suggesting an orchestrated interplay of fate determination that gives rise to the required cell diversity of the human cerebral cortex.",data collection project,,"Dataset: Aparna Bhaduri, Neel Parikshak, Li Wang, Arnold Kriegstein (2021) Single-Cell Sequencing of the Developing Human Brain: 10x 3' v3 sequencing [Dataset].

Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility of >75,000 cells from eight distinct areas of developing human forebrain using single cell ATAC-seq (scATACseq). We identified thousands of loci that undergo extensive cell type-specific changes in accessibility during corticogenesis. Chromatin state profiling also reveals novel distinctions between neural progenitor cells from different cortical areas not seen in transcriptomic profiles and suggests a role for retinoic acid signaling in cortical arealization. Comparison of the cell type-specific chromatin landscape of cerebral organoids to primary developing cortex found that organoids establish broad cell type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns similar to the developing cortex, but lack many putative regulatory elements identified in homologous primary cell types.

kriegstein_sn_10x_proj,Single-Nuclei Sequencing of Late Stages of Human Brain Development and Early Postnatal Life,10x 3' v2 sequencing,"Human cortical development spans years of prenatal and postnatal development. This incredibly complex process involves multiple interacting cell lineages and dynamic processes, such as neurogenesis and gliogenesis, neuronal migration, cell differentiation, areal specification, axon outgrowth and synapse formation and maturation. Human cortical development proceeds through a number of critical stages that are believed to be affected in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In order to investigate the dynamic landscape of human cortical development at the single-cell resolution, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile more than 100 post-mortem human cortical tissue samples from over 50 individuals and three cortical areas. We included samples ranging from second and third trimesters of prenatal development though neonatal and early postnatal stages to teenage and early adult years. By using unbiased nuclei isolation coupled with droplet-based single-cell profiling (10x Genomics), we generated over 300,000 single-nucleus transcriptomics profiles. We performed unbiased clustering, marker discovery and trajectory analysis, and were able to discover gene expression programs that underlie generation of subtypes of cortical projection neurons, interneurons and glial cell types, as well as critical process of development, such as generation of astrocytes, axon outgrowth, synapse formation and formation of mature cortical neuronal circuits. By intersecting cell type-specific developmental gene expression profiles with known genetic risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders, we were able to identify cell types and developmental stages that can be especially affected in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, leading to improper formation and function of specific cortical circuits. Our study sheds light on cell type-specific mechanisms of normal cortical development and cell types and processes affected in common neurodevelopmental disease. In addition, our rich single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas will be of great value to a wide range of neuroscientists.",data collection project,,"Dataset:  Dmitry Velmeshev, Arnold Kriegstein (2021) Single-Nuclei Sequencing of Late Stages of Human Brain Development and Early Postnatal Life [Dataset].

We use two recently developed methods that rely on combinatorial indexing to cost-effectively profile the epigenomes (sci-ATAC-seq) and transcriptomes (sci-RNA-seq) of large numbers of cells. The first aim of the project is to generate high resolution, single cell epigenetic and transcriptional atlases of one male and one female rhesus macaque brain by profiling chromatin accessibility in 750,000 nuclei (sci-ATAC-seq) and transcription in 1,500,000 nuclei (sci-RNA-seq) from each of two macaque brains (for a total of 4.5 million cells).

We have developed an innovative mouse genetic tool, called Mosaicism with Repeat Frameshift (or MORF), which enables sparsely and stochastically labeling of genetically-defined neurons in mice. MORF reporter mice can label in exquisite detail single neurons from dendrite and spines to axons and axonal terminals at a labeling frequency of 1-5% of a given neuronal population. We propose to cross our new MORF lines with Cre mouse lines for striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of direct- and indirect pathways, and for cortical pyramidal neurons of distinct cortical layers (i.e. L2/3/4, L5 and L6). Each MORF/Cre mouse will allow us to image the detailed dendritic morphology for thousands of genetically-defined striatal and cortical neurons (i.e. dendritome). We have also developed and streamlined imaging and computational tools to acquire and register brainwide single neuron morphological data onto a standard reference mouse brain atlas. We will digitally reconstruct hundreds of thousands of MORF-labeled neurons using our novel program called G-Cut. Reconstructed neurons will subsequently used for morphology based clustering to define new morphological subtypes, which in turn can be analyzed for the expression of novel molecular markers neuronal cell types (e.g. from single cell RNA-sequencing).

Transgenic or viral strategies were used to sparsely label specific neuron populations in the brain with fluorescent reporters. For whole-brain imaging, the intact brain was embedded in glycol methacrylate resin. By using the fMOST technology, each embedded brain can be imaged at 0.3 x 0.3 x 1 micron resolution. This entire strategy can acquire a three-dimensional image set that can identify dendrites, axons and their terminals across the whole mouse brain. The complete morphology of each individual neuron, including its soma, dendrites and axon arborization, was fully reconstructed using the Vaa3D platform.

zhangK_multiome_proj,Toward a Human Adult Brain Cell Atlas with Single-Cell Technologies,Single-Cell Human Adult Brain Cell Atlas,"Towards producing a complete cell atlas of the human brain, including a full molecular catalog of all its cell types and their spatial distribution, we propose interrogating the human brain by combining three cutting-edge technologies: 1) a next-generation single-nucleus transcriptome sequencing method (snDrop-Seq), 2) a highly multiplexed single-cell DNA accessibility assay (scTHS-Seq), and 3) a highly multiplexed RNA in situ mapping method (DART-FISH). We will employ a pipeline that leverages enhanced non-diseased human brain collection capable of providing a non-limiting source of clinically validated, high quality brain tissue of matched ages and sex. Our pipeline will include: basic clinical information of non-brain diseased donors from which the post-mortem interval (PMI) will be limited to 24 hours or less; post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological examination to select brains that are not complicated by occult disease; rapid freezing to maintain neuroanatomical landmarks for spatial registration. The selected brains will be assayed by these three technologies producing transcriptome, accessibility, and spatial data at single cell resolution. Novel computational approaches will also be developed for scalable and efficient integration and analysis of data at these larger and more complex scales that will encompass all known cell types in the brain, not limited to neurons. We will systematically apply these methods to produce reference single-cell maps for female and male brains, extending to all 44 human Brodmann Areas (BAs) of the cerebral cortex as well as comprehensive sampling through subcortical divisions of adult brain, and construct a spatial multi-omic map of the human brain.",data collection project,,,

The projections are specific and stereotypical - such that single glomeruli are formed by the projections of neurons expressing the same receptor gene and the spatial organization of these projections is highly reproducible from animal to animal across different receptor genes. It has been hypothesized that the 3D projection map of olfactory receptors converts molecular information into spatial organization, which is crucial for the coding and downstream processing of olfactory sensory information. Here we use the high throughput and sensitivity of MERFISH to identify the receptor mRNA molecules trafficked along the axons into the glomeruli structures in order to define their receptor identity.
