To characterize the cell type-specificty of the enhancers reporter mice were injected the AAV. Virus-infected cells were isolated from the brain by fluorescence activated sorting of cells was performed based on expression of fluorescent reporter labels and sorted into into separate tubes. Isolated cells were processed for single cell RNA sequencing using SMARTer v4. This method enables tracking of dissection location and high gene detection per cell to identify fine differences in gene expression and highly selective marker genes.,open,in progress,2022/09/30

zeng_he_sn_RNAseq_SPN,A transcriptomic taxonomy of mouse brain-wide spinal projecting neurons,Mouse SPN Taxonomy - 10x,"The brain controls nearly all bodily functions via spinal projecting neurons (SPNs) that carry command signals from the brain to the spinal cord. However, a comprehensive molecular characterization of brain-wide SPNs is still lacking. Here, we transcriptionally profiled a total of 65,002 SPNs, identified 76 region-specific SPN types, and mapped these types into a companion atlas of the whole mouse brain. This taxonomy reveals a three-component organization of SPNs: (1) molecularly homogeneous excitatory SPNs from the cortex, red nucleus, and cerebellum with somatotopic spinal terminations suitable for point-to-point communication; (2) heterogeneous populations in the reticular formation with broad spinal termination patterns, suitable for relaying commands related to the activities of the entire spinal cord; and (3) modulatory neurons expressing slow-acting neurotransmitters and/or neuropeptides in the hypothalamus, midbrain, and reticular formation for gain control of brain-spinal signals. Further, this atlas revealed a LIM homeobox transcription factor code that parcellates the reticulospinal neurons into five molecularly distinct and spatially segregated populations.Finally, we found transcriptional signatures of a subset of SPNs with large soma size and correlated these with fast-firing electrophysiological properties. Together, this study establishes a comprehensive taxonomy of brain-wide SPNs and provides insight into the functional organization of SPNs in mediating brain control of bodily functions.",open,complete,2024/02/14

We performed MERFISH imaging on 150 coronal sections from this animal, obtained 4.8 million segmented cells that passed quality control, and integrated the MERFISH data (including data from all four animals) with the scRNA-seq data from the Allen Institute to classify cells. We applied a series of filters to select a subset of cells to be visualized on the ABC atlas. We first removed three fractured tissue slices and 4.7 million cells remained after this step. Then we aligned the spatial coordinates of the cells to the Allen-CCF-2020. For the slices that can be registered to the CCF, we used the CCF coordinates to define the coordinates of the center point of the midline and removed cells that substantially passed the midline in the other hemisphere (which has not been registered to the CCF). For the 18 slices that are at the anterior and posterior ends of the brain and cannot be registered to the CCF, we manually aligned and oriented these slices to determine the coordinates of the center point of the midline. The x, y coordinates are experimentally measured coordinates after rotating and aligning the tissue slices to the CCF, and the z coordinates are estimated position of each tissue slice in the 3D Allen-CCF 2020 space along the anterior-posterior axis based on either the registration results (for slices that can be registered to CCF) or anterior-posterior positions of the slices measured during tissue sectioning (for the slices that cannot be registered). The z position is set to zero when the estimated position becomes zero or negative, therefore multiple anterior slices have a “0” value for their z coordinates. 4.2 million cells remained after this step. The cell-by-gene matrix of the 4.2 millions cells can be downloaded from the AWS bucket of this animal. We then filtered the cells by cell-classification (label transfer) confidence scores calculated during MERFISH-scRNAseq data integration. 3.4 million cells passed the confidence score threshold for cell subclass label transfer and 2.8 million cells further passed the confidence score threshold for cell cluster label transfer. These 2.8 million cells are included in the cell metadata file that can be downloaded from the AWS bucket and are displayed on the ABC Atlas.

For the 3 lateral slices that cannot be registered to the CCF, we manually aligned and oriented the slices. The x, y coordinates are experimentally measured coordinates after rotating and aligning the tissue slices to the CCF, and the z coordinates are estimated position of each tissue slice in the 3D Allen-CCF 2020 space along the medial-lateral axis based on either the registration results (for slices that can be registered to CCF) or medial-lateral positions of the slices measured during tissue sectioning (for the slices that cannot be registered). 2.1 million cells remained after this step.
