ConnBdaAavProj,Mouse Connectivity BDA/AAV Comparison,BDA AAV comp,"The recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been widely adopted recently for labeling axonal projections because of its distinct advantages over classic anterograde tracers such as biotinylated dextran amines (BDA) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA-L). In spite of the increasing use of viral tracers, little data exists to allow one to compare labeling efficiency or specificity between two popular tracing methods in diverse brain regions. In order to compare viral  and conventional (BDA) tracers, approximately 20 brain regions were selected to represent broad anatomical areas and diverse cell types. rAAV and BDA were co-injected into each selected brain region in wild-type mice using a sequential injection method developed to target virtually the same anatomic region. For most cases presented, the anatomical area(s) of tracer uptake are well matched. However, there are cases with considerable differences in the uptake area between BDA and rAAV due to uneven infection or leakage along the needle tract or into neighboring anatomical regions. Axonal projections from neurons infected/labeled by rAAV or BDA were visualized with distinct fluorescent colors in subsequent histological staining procedures and imaged on an automated fluorescence scanner.",data collection project,,,

This profiling was performed in two major phases. The first is a developmental timeseries spanning postnatal development in a set of specific forebrain regions. These regions match those assayed using DNA microarrays in the other major portion of the NHP atlas. The second is a cellular resolution analysis of a targeted gene set across entire hemispheres of the entire adult rhesus brain. A standardized processing pipeline was used to section tissue samples, perform histological staining, generate standardized colorimetric ISH data, and acquire images from the resulting stained tissue. For cellular resolution localization of gene expression in specific anatomical regions and cell types across postnatal development, genes were selected from several categories of broad scientific and clinical interest, including highly restricted marker genes for specific anatomical regions and cell types, gene families important to neural function, disease-related genes and genes important in the comparative genomics field. ISH data are presented for medial prefrontal cortex, primary visual cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and ventral striatum, with genes for each structure assayed across the four timepoints neonate (birth), infant (3 months), juvenile (12 months), and post-pubertal adult (48 months) in three male specimens. For cellular resolution localization of gene expression throughout the entire adult brain, ISH data are generated serially across complete hemispheres of three post-pubertal adult (48 months) male specimens, focusing on cellular marker genes, genes with cortical area specificity and gene families important to neural function. Complementing the ISH data across a complete hemisphere are the histological stains Nissl, acetylcholinesterase and SMI-32 that combined with the ISH data provide an unprecedented cellular resolution view into the post-pubertal adult brain.",data collection project,,,

The primary data component of the NHP atlas is genome-wide transcriptional profiling aimed at the identification of transcriptional programs differentially regulated in specific brain regions at different stages of brain maturation. This profiling was performed in rhesus macaque across pre- and postnatal development to provide a full developmental time course from early brain formation through adulthood. The methodological approach aimed to isolate and analyze all histologically discrete developmental and mature partitions (e.g., layers, nuclei) of the neocortex (primary visual cortex and medial prefrontal cortex), hippocampus, striatum and amygdala. Two different tissue isolation strategies were utilized (laser microdissection and microdissection) and RNA isolated from these samples was amplified and used for DNA microarray analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Rhesus Macaque Genome Arrays. Laser microdissection was used to isolate target brain regions from tissue sections across six prenatal developmental stages (E40, E50, E70, E80, E90, and E120), corresponding to peak periods of neurogenesis for the different layers of primary visual cortex based on birth-dating experiments. Postnatal stages were also profiled using laser microdissection at each of four postnatal developmental stages representing the neonate (0 months), infant (3 months), juvenile (12 months) and post-pubertal adult (48 months).

A major component of the NHP Atlas is genome-wide transcriptional profiling aimed at the identification of transcriptional programs differentially active at different stages of brain maturation in neonates, infants, juveniles and adults. Also, a significant component of the NHP Atlas consists of cellular level in situ hybridization (ISH) on medial prefrontal cortex, primary visual cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and ventral striatum with a panel of genes for each structure assayed across four time points (birth, 3 months, 12 months, and 48 months). In addition, ISH data serially across complete hemispheres of three 48-month male specimens was included. To complement these postnatal gene expression datasets, stage-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological reference series for each developmental time point was generated to provide a developmental neuroanatomical framework of reference for the ISH and microarray data. An interleaved atlas of MRI, histology, and block face photographs was created from four male rhesus macaques at the following ages: 2 weeks (birth), 3 months, 12 months, and 48 months.

kriegstein_sc_10x_proj,Single-Cell Sequencing of the Developing Human Brain,10x 3' v2 and v3 sequencing,"The human brain is composed of diverse cell types across brain regions that enable unique capabilities. Within the brain, the cerebral cortex is responsible for a number of cognitive functions and sensory integration, with distinct cortical regions controlling a variety of tasks including motion, vision, speech, and judgment. Recent work exploring the cell types of two distinct cortical regions in the human and mouse suggests that excitatory neurons are area specific and emerge during developmental stages of peak neurogenesis. However, further characterization of cortical arealization is required to understand whether gradients, sharp boundaries, or some combination of patterns describes the areal distribution of neurons and other cortical cell types. Importantly, accurate modeling of cortical development and understanding biological constraints for any attempts at stem cell therapies requires characterizing when neuroepithelia or radial glia transition from a uniform population into areal specific progenitors, and the degree to which they are committed to an areal fate. In order to comprehensively characterize the areal diversity of cell types during human development, we performed single-cell sequencing of a variety of cortical regions and sub-cortical structures from 20 intact first and second trimester brain samples. With over a million cells, we identify hundreds of cells types including temporal and area specific neurons, interneurons and radial glia populations, as well as a number of subtypes from each of these classes that are expressed across most cortical areas. Additionally, we find a small number of subpopulations of neuroepithelial cells and identify several key pathways that may regulate the switch from neuroepithelia to radial glia identity. Together, these datasets suggest a model of both area restricted progenitor populations as well as radial glia cell types that are observed across cortical regions, suggesting an orchestrated interplay of fate determination that gives rise to the required cell diversity of the human cerebral cortex.",data collection project,,,

However, studies of the epigenomic landscape of the developing human brain have yet to be performed at single-cell resolution. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility of >75,000 cells from eight distinct areas of developing human forebrain using single cell ATAC-seq (scATACseq). We identified thousands of loci that undergo extensive cell type-specific changes in accessibility during corticogenesis. Chromatin state profiling also reveals novel distinctions between neural progenitor cells from different cortical areas not seen in transcriptomic profiles and suggests a role for retinoic acid signaling in cortical arealization. Comparison of the cell type-specific chromatin landscape of cerebral organoids to primary developing cortex found that organoids establish broad cell type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns similar to the developing cortex, but lack many putative regulatory elements identified in homologous primary cell types. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development.",data collection project,,,
kriegstein_sn_10x_proj,Single-Nuclei Sequencing of Late Stages of Human Brain Development and Early Postnatal Life,10x 3' v2 sequencing,"Human cortical development spans years of prenatal and postnatal development. This incredibly complex process involves multiple interacting cell lineages and dynamic processes, such as neurogenesis and gliogenesis, neuronal migration, cell differentiation, areal specification, axon outgrowth and synapse formation and maturation. Human cortical development proceeds through a number of critical stages that are believed to be affected in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In order to investigate the dynamic landscape of human cortical development at the single-cell resolution, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile more than 100 post-mortem human cortical tissue samples from over 50 individuals and three cortical areas. We included samples ranging from second and third trimesters of prenatal development though neonatal and early postnatal stages to teenage and early adult years. By using unbiased nuclei isolation coupled with droplet-based single-cell profiling (10x Genomics), we generated over 300,000 single-nucleus transcriptomics profiles. We performed unbiased clustering, marker discovery and trajectory analysis, and were able to discover gene expression programs that underlie generation of subtypes of cortical projection neurons, interneurons and glial cell types, as well as critical process of development, such as generation of astrocytes, axon outgrowth, synapse formation and formation of mature cortical neuronal circuits. By intersecting cell type-specific developmental gene expression profiles with known genetic risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders, we were able to identify cell types and developmental stages that can be especially affected in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, leading to improper formation and function of specific cortical circuits. Our study sheds light on cell type-specific mechanisms of normal cortical development and cell types and processes affected in common neurodevelopmental disease. In addition, our rich single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas will be of great value to a wide range of neuroscientists.",data collection project,,,

Here we propose a novel approach to classify neuronal cell types by brainwide comprehensive profiling of the dendritic morphology of genetically-defined neurons in the mouse brain. We have developed an innovative mouse genetic tool, called Mosaicism with Repeat Frameshift (or MORF), which enables sparsely and stochastically labeling of genetically-defined neurons in mice. MORF reporter mice can label in exquisite detail single neurons from dendrite and spines to axons and axonal terminals at a labeling frequency of 1-5% of a given neuronal population. We propose to cross our new MORF lines with Cre mouse lines for striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of direct- and indirect pathways, and for cortical pyramidal neurons of distinct cortical layers (i.e. L2/3/4, L5 and L6). Each MORF/Cre mouse will allow us to image the detailed dendritic morphology for thousands of genetically-defined striatal and cortical neurons (i.e. dendritome). We have also developed and streamlined imaging and computational tools to acquire and register brainwide single neuron morphological data onto a standard reference mouse brain atlas. We will digitally reconstruct hundreds of thousands of MORF-labeled neurons using our novel program called G-Cut. Reconstructed neurons will subsequently used for morphology based clustering to define new morphological subtypes, which in turn can be analyzed for the expression of novel molecular markers neuronal cell types (e.g. from single cell RNA-sequencing).  Finally, we will disseminate the data to the Brain Cell Data Center (BCDC) for data integration with those from other BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and for data access by the broader neuroscience research community.

Reconstructions of thalamus are grouped to sensory relay nuclei like VP, LGN, MG, VL etc. and higher order nuclei like PO, RT, etc. Strikingly, multiple axon clusters of single neuron present layer specific projections and highlights the projection which have been overlooked in population level, like VPM projecting to secondary sensory cortex. Axonal branching patterns are with different characteristics from different nuclei, like Neurons located in Reticular nucleus display netting pattern.

This method enables a rapid, large-scale survey of cell types in brain regions with accurate recovery of cell type proportions, but at low gene coverage per nucleus. This dataset surveys cells in the primary motor cortex (MOp) as well as regions where isolation of whole cells is difficult, or nuclear profiling is needed to establish cell type proportions.",data collection project,,,
zeng_sn_SSv4_proj,Transcriptomic cell types in the mouse brain: SMART-seq nuclei,SMART-seq v4,"Our goal is to create a high-quality atlas of cell types in the mouse brain using large scale single cell transcriptomic analysis across the entire mouse brain. Fine dissections of brain regions and layers were performed from both hemispheres of male and female mice. Nuclei were extracted from dissected tissues, and fluorescence activated sorting of nuclei was performed based on antibody labeling of NeuN protein to sort individual nuclei into separate wells. Isolated nuclei were processed for single nuclei RNA sequencing using SMARTer v4. This method enables tracking of dissection location and moderate gene detection per nucleus with accurate recovery of cell type proportions within (but not between) each tissue sample. This dataset surveys cells in the primary motor cortex (MOp) as well as regions where isolation of whole cells is difficult, or nuclear profiling is needed to establish cell type proportions.",data collection project,,,

human_cortex,Human Multiple Cortical Areas - SMART-seq,Human CTX SSv4,"To investigate the cellular diversity across human cortex, we used SMART-Seq v4 single nucleus RNA-sequencing that provides a relatively unbiased survey of cell types and can be applied to neurosurgical and frozen, postmortem tissue. Individual layers of cortex were dissected from brain tissues including the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), anterior cingulate gyrus (CgGr), primary visual cortex (V1C), primary motor cortex (M1C), primary somatosensory cortex (S1C) and primary auditory cortex (A1C), and nuclei were dissociated and sorted using the neuronal marker NeuN. In total, nuclei from MTG were sampled from four postmortem donor brains and four neurosurgical donor brains and nuclei from the remaining regions were sampled from 3 postmortem donor brains. Profiled nuclei included approximately 90% neurons and 10% glia.
