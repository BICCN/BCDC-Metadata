# NeMO audit File Manifests

Directory for File Manifests and Specimen Inventories for the data collections included in the NeMO file audit for 2021 Q1. 
For each project, CSVs were generated for:

1. A Specimen Inventory of samples in the BCDC inventory that have files at NeMO, with an added column of 'Files per Sample'
2. A File Manifest generated for all matched files in the NeMO audit list, including associated Sample ID, NeMO ID, and File URI at NeMO, 
as well as checksums provided by NeMO when available 
4. A Specimen Inventory of samples in the BCDC inventory that had **no** matched files in the NeMO audit
