# BCDC-Metadata
Interim repository for BCDC metadata per quarter.

The BCDC maintains a Cell Registry to report the inventory of data generated by BICCN funded labs and submitted to the BICCN data archives NeMO, BIL, and DANDI. 

## Metadata Templates
Two templates are currently available for metadata collection:
* Dataset Metadata.  This metadata describes a dataset with sufficient information to provide a landing page or DOI page that describes the type of data, scientific intent, contributors, funding, license information, etc. 
* Sample Inventory Metadata.   Our quarterly metadata collection to date has been the sample inventory metadata. This provides information about how much data has been provided to each repository with some minimal metadata fields.   

## Sample Inventory
The Sample Inventory is a listing of samples and associated cells or brains profiled for each sample for each dataset, reported on a quarterly basis. This is suitable for identifying the transgenic line and anatomic region sampled in a manageable spreadsheet, but is not intended to include more detailed provenance metadata. These are currently provided as snapshots per quarter.
