# BCDC-Metadata
Interim repository for BCDC metadata per quarter.

The BCDC maintains a Cell Registry to report the inventory of data generated by BICCN funded labs and submitted to the BICCN data archives NeMO, BIL, and DANDI. 

## Metadata Templates
Work in progress.

## Sample Inventory
The Sample Inventory is a listing of samples and associated cells or brains profiled for each sample for each dataset, reported on a quarterly basis. This is suitable for identifying the transgenic line and anatomic region sampled in a manageable spreadsheet, but is not intended to include more detailed provenance metadata. These are currently provided as snapshots per quarter.

## Detailed Metadata
Work in progress.
