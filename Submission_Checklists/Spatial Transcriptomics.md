# Spatial Transcriptomics Submission Checklist

As part of Spatial Transcriptomics submission, please fill out the metadata submission forms in your google drive, including the Sample Inventory metadata, and the Dataset Metadata. 
Guidance for data submission below:

|Type of Data|	Archive	|Special Notes|
|---------------------------|---|---|
|☐ Raw data	|BIL	|REQUIRED.  Raw data is very useful for such new technologies as spatial transcriptomics as this helps others have data to benchmark against and supports development of new image processing and analysis tools. File size is not a limiting factor for the archive; email the BIL archive on best ways to upload large data files.  Spacetx format is preferred; consult with the archive for support on formats.|
|☐ Processed Data: Spot x gene, Cell mask, Cell x gene	|BIL	|REQUIRED.  Use schema from Starspace for spots (mRNA localizations), regions(segmented cells), and matrix (cell x gene) |
|☐ Sample Inventory	|BCDC	|REQUIRED.  Use the form provided in your google drive.|
|☐ Dataset Metadata	|BCDC	|REQUIRED.  Use the form provided in your google drive.|
